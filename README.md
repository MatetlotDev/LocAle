# LocAle
A mobile app created to find every brewery and beers around you, wherever you're located.

## Why ?
I created this project to have a first experience with mobile application and with React Native.

## Where the idea come from ?
I can see a lot of people paying beers in supermarket and don't really care where the beer come from. 
So I got the idea, why not building an app to show people all the good beers around them and make them having a smaller ecologic impact  with the travelling of their beers.

# Technos
For this project I have used these different technologies : 
- React Native (with Expo cli), for the Frontend
- Node JS, for the environment 
- MongoDB, for the Database
- Express JS, for the Backend
